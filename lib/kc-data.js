The validation of the present approach is shown by comparison with numerical results reported in the literature. The influences of the fiber spatial distributions and the imperfect fiber-matrix interface contact conditions on the effective properties are analyzed. Spatial fiber distribution induces some value changes in the magneto-electric coefficient and two possible composites property symmetry are obtained: monoclinic 2 and transversely isotropic. The effect of the imperfect contact parameter has a more pronounced value on the ME coefficient than the fiber distribution. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Coupling of 2,3,5-triiodobenzaldehyde to the PVA backbone of pre-formed beads yields a uniformly distributed level of iodine attached throughout the bead structure (-150mg/mL) which is sufficient to be imaged under standard fluoroscopy and computed tomography (CT) imaging modalities used in treatment procedures (DC Bead LUMITM). Despite the chemical modification increasing the density of the beads to -1.3 g/cm(3) and the compressive modulus by two orders of magnitude, they remain easily suspended, handled and administered through standard microcatheters. As the core chemistry of DC Bead LUMITM is the same as DC Bead(TM), it interacts with drugs using ion-exchange between sulfonic acid groups on the polymer and the positively charged amine groups of the drugs.

    "allText": "In the daily operation of metro systems, the train scheduling problem aims to find a set of space-time paths for multiple trains that determine their departure and arrival times at metro stations, while train operations are in charge of selecting the best operational speed to satisfy the punctuality and operation costs. Different from the most existing researches that treat these two problems separately, this paper proposes an integrated approach for the train scheduling problem on a bi-direction urban metro line in order to minimize the operational costs (i.e., energy consumption) and passenger waiting time. More specifically, we simultaneously consider (1) the train operational velocity choices that correspond to the energy consumption of trains on each travelling arc, and (2) the dynamic passenger demands at each station for the calculation of total passenger waiting time in the planning horizon. By employing a space-time network representation in the formulations, this complex train scheduling and control problem with dynamic passenger demands is rigorously formulated into two optimization models with linear forms. The first model is an integer programming model that jointly minimizes train traction energy consumption and passenger waiting time. The second model, which is formulated as a mixed-integer programming model, further considers the utilization of regenerative braking energy on the basis of the first model. Due to the computational complexity of these two models, especially for large-scale real-world instances, we develop a Lagrangian relaxation (LR)-based heuristic algorithm that decomposes the primal problem into two sets of subproblems and thus enables to find a good solution in short computational time.

    "allText": "A High Performance Computing alternative to traditional Krylov subspace methods, pipelined Krylov subspace solvers offer better scalability in the strong scaling limit compared to standard Krylov subspace methods for large and sparse linear systems. The typical synchronization bottleneck is mitigated by overlapping time-consuming global communication phases with local computations in the algorithm. This paper describes a general framework for deriving the pipelined variant of any Krylov subspace algorithm. The proposed framework was implicitly used to derive the pipelined Conjugate Gradient (p-CG) method in Hiding global synchronization latency in the preconditioned Conjugate Gradient algorithm by P. Ghysels and W. Vanroose, Parallel Computing, 40(7):224-238, 2014. The pipelining framework is subsequently illustrated by formulating a pipelined version of the BiCGStab method for the solution of large unsymmetric linear systems on parallel hardware. A residual replacement strategy is proposed to account for the possible loss of attainable accuracy and robustness by the pipelined BiCGStab method. It is shown that the pipelined algorithm improves scalability on distributed memory machines, leading to significant speedups compared to standard preconditioned BiCGStab. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, this study explored the use of adhesively bonded CFRP flexible sheets on retrofitting square hollow section (SHS) steel columns under the eccentric compression load, using numerical investigations. Finite Element Method (FEM) was employed for modeling. To determine ultimate load of SHS steel columns, eight specimens with two types of section (Type A and B), strengthened using CFRP sheets, were analyzed under different coverage lengths, the number of layers, and the location of CFRP composites. Two specimens were analyzed without strengthening (control) to determine the increasing rate of the ultimate load in strengthened steel columns. ANSYS was used to analyze the SHS steel columns. The results showed that the CFRP composite had no similar effect on the slender and stocky SHS steel columns. The results also showed that the coverage length, the number of layers, and the location of CFRP composites were effective in increasing the ultimate load of the SHS steel columns."
