We tested our hypotheses in the context of Wikipedia 's Collaborations of the Week ( COTW ) , a group goal setting mechanism and a social event within Wikiprojects . Results demonstrate that 1 ) publicizing important group goals via COTW can have a strong motivating influence on editors who have voluntarily identified themselves as group members compared to those who have not self-identified ; 2 ) the effects of goals spill over to non-goal related tasks ; and 3 ) editors exposed to group role models in COTW are more likely to perform similarly to the models on group-relevant citizenship behaviors .
